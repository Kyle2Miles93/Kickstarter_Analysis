# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns!
### A project analyzing kickstarters' success and failure

Here is a line chart showing various outcomes
for the kickstarter campaigns:

Here is a pivot-chart showing a basic distribution
of the various outcomes in a different way:

We have concluded the following about the kickstarter data:
* The more money a campaign asks for, the greater
discrepancy between the goal and the amount received.
* Kickstarters in the Theater category in Great Britain,
in particular, were not very successful overall
while plays produced in the US were highly successful.
* The less "lofty" the goal amount, the more
likely the amount pledged will reach that goal.
* Based on the launch date, the success-rate
was highest in the months of May and June across the board.

We suggest Louise start a kickstarter campaign with a goal amount not too high
(do not exceed 10,000 pounds-the trend shows that any higher will be too much based
on the results of our anayses). A "realistic" goal is recommended. We also suggest
starting the campaign in May or June, so early summer would be ideal. If starting
a kickstarter in Great Britain, then try to start a campaign
for something other than theater, like food or television.
